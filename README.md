# schnapsum-sublime-text

It allows you to Insert Lorem Ipsum in the editor via menu items or keyboard shortcut.

Schnapsum text is built by the creator of the original Schnapsum [raphaelgoetter/brackets-schnapsum](https://github.com/raphaelgoetter/brackets-schnapsum).

So take advantage of Schnapsum in Alsatian, the modern and trendy language to create your fake texts and fill your pages with content. Hopla!

## Install

### Install manually


### Package Control

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

 * If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text before doing this next bit.
 * Bring up the Command Palette `(command+shift+p` on OS X, `control+shift+p` on Linux/Windows).
 * Enter "Package Control: Install Package"
 * Select Schnapsum when the list appears.

## How does it work?

Select how much text you want from the menu item in `Edit->Text->Schnapsum` or on the right click menu in `Schnapsum`.

Just press the shortcut key `(alt+shift+l)` to add Schnapsum text. Keep pressing to add more.

## Uninstall with the Command Palette
